Scheme interpreter with real-time scheduling support and event support.

This is very much a work in progress. The goal is to have a scheme with added 
syntax to aid in the design of real-time applications like games and visualisations.
Any sufficiently advanced animation engine will have a state-machine that approaches
the structure of a language interpreter, so why not turn it around?
